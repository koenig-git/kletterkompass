Recht niedrige Decke, nicht allzu groß.

The Queen's Guard and Queen's Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army's London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen's Guard is also mounted at the sovereign's other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen's private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.

> Fazit:

Der Monkeyspot liegt in der Neuenhofstraße 91 in Duisburg. Genügend Parkplätze vor Ort. 12€ Erwachsene 10,50€ Ermäßigt
